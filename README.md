# Shopify Provider for ShopApp iOS
This library contains the Shopify provider for [ShopApp for iOS](https://github.com/rubygarage/shopapp-ios). ShopApp is an application that turns a Shopify-based store into a mobile app. ShopApp syncs with Shopify store and transfers a product catalog and user data to a mobile app. The app provides features like customizable push notifications, promo codes, and convenient payments with popular digital wallets like Apple Pay.
